# Course Outcomes
**Aims & Objectives**  
This module serves as an introduction to probability and a foundation for understanding statistics, randomness, and uncertainty.

**Syllabus**  
Basic concepts of probability, conditional probability, independence, random variables, joint and marginal distributions, mean and variance, some common probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation and hypothesis testing based on a normal population.

# 0. Introduction to Probability and Statistics
|  | Probability | Statistics |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters (Underlying random processes) | Known  | Unknown |
| Events/Data | Output | Input |

p = population proportion  
$\mu$ = population mean  
P-hat ($\hat{p}$) = sample proportion  
X-bar ($\bar{x}$) = sample mean  
Statistical Experiment: Any procedure generating a set of observations/outcomes  
Sample point/element: Every outcome in a sample space  
Sample space: Set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment (represented by symbol `S`)  
Event: Subset of a sample space  

# 1. Sets & Operations
||||
|---|---|---|
| Union (OR) | $ A \cup B $ | Anything that contains at least one of either set |
| Intersection (AND) | $ A \cap B $ | Anything that ONLY contains both intersecting sets |
| Complement (EXCLUDE) | $A^c$ or $A'$ or $\complement A$| Anything that does not inlude the set |
| Null set | $\emptyset$ | Nothing exists in the set |
| Disjoint (Mutually Exclusive) | $ A \cup B $ = $\emptyset$ | No common element among intersecting sets |
| Subset | $A \subset B$ | A part of B  ($A \subset B$) & ($B \subset A$) then A = B|
| Superset | B âŠƒ A | B contains A |

De Morgan's Law:
1. $(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n )' = A_1' \cap A_2' \cap ... \cap A_n' $
2. $(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n )' = A_1' \cup A_2' \cup ... \cup A_n' $

# 2. Counting Methods
* Addition Principle: $n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k$
* Multiplication Principle: $n_1 \times n_2 \times ... \times n_k$
* Permutation (r-selection without replacement & sequence matters): $ _n P_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
    * When r = n, $ _n P_n = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = n! $
* Combination (r-selection without replacement & disregard sequence): $ _n C_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = \frac{_n P_r}{r!} $
